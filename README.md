It's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside! No, it really is - as you can(not) see, most of the action happens in private repositories 🔍&nbsp;<img src="assets/contributions_sm.png" >

I'm a backend developer fueled by curiosity, sugar, and an unapologetic love for solving puzzles. Whether it's wrangling legacy code or building something shiny and new, I thrive on diving headfirst into challenges. My tools of the trade are Java and Delphi - an unusual combo, but one that keeps things interesting! 🛠️
